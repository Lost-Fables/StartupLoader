# StartupLoader
A Java 11 friendly pre-loader for Jars on the Minecraft platform.

Place any pre-loaded jars within root/StartupLoader/jars on either Bungee or Spigot and they'll be loaded in prior to OnEnable() methods are touched.

Use dist for either Spigot or Bungee, or use the individual jars for each platform. Ignore common as it does nothing without the overhead jars.
